Oregon Trail Engine
===================

# What is this?
Game.py is a general purpose Oregon Trail game engine.
Many of the parameters in a standard OregonTail game are read in from .dat files instead of being hard-coded into the game engine.
This allows users to create their own adventures with varying themes, events, and actions.
Included are the .dat files for a default adventure that we have already developed for you.

# Usage
To run the game you simply need to run this command

<pre><code>./Game.py</code></pre>

To run our data file creation utility, you need to run this command

<pre><code>./CreateGame.py</code></pre>
